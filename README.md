## How to create a user in a database
#### By: Cody Whitaker

**Summary**: This is an IT tutorial that teaches and walks you through every step to create a user within an sql server database. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a user, add the new user to the schema groups, assigning the correct permissions to that user, and making sure that user is mapped to a login. I believe this can be a helpful guide for anybody wanting to learn the basics of databases with no prior knowledge or a DBA that's just getting started in the work force.
